I struggled a lot in the early portion of the class getting logged into all of my accounts and then again with learning probuilder. In the end, I was successfully able to make a
low-detail rocket, platform, and risers. I feel like I adequately learned a good chunk of how to use the mechanics of probuilder, but only with basic shapes. For about 20 minutes
I really struggled figuring out how to use the door shape, and I still never got it down. Otherwise, I enjoyed this very much.
